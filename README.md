# ECommerce - Backend
## .NET WebAPI
### WORK IN PROGRESS

### This is my implementation of the backend for my E-Commerce solution. Using C# and ASP.NET Core, I have developed endpoints responsible for manipulating and retrieving data from a Microsoft SQL Server database. Entity Framework Core is used for seeding the database with example data and managing relationships between tables.
### Hereâ€™s an example of using an entity to create a table with a relationship to another table:

### Below is the complete database diagram:

### Each endpoint serves a specific purpose. For example, the following endpoint is responsible for retrieving data from the *Products* table:

### To ensure that the original objects remain unchanged, I use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs). After running the application, the Swagger page displays a list of all API endpoints:
